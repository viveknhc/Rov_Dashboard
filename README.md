# ROV Dashboard

A real-time control and monitoring dashboard for marine robotic platforms, built with React.

## Features

-   **Real-Time Telemetry**: simulated depth, temperature, pressure, heading, and speed updates.
-   **Live Video Functionality**: Placeholder for ROV camera feed with overlay.
-   **Controls**:
    -   Start/Stop Recording (with emergency stop logic).
    -   Emergency Stop (halts system).
    -   Numeric limits for depth and speed.
-   **Data Visualization**:
    -   Real-time charts for sensor data (using `recharts`).
    -   System logs with timeline view.
-   **Theme Support**: Toggle between Dark (default) and Light modes.

## Setup & Run

1.  Current directory:
    ```bash
    cd rov
    ```
2.  Install dependencies:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```
3.  Start the development server:
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```

## Architecture

-   **State Management**:
    -   `TelemetryContext`: Manages simulated real-time data and system state (recording, emergency).
    -   `ThemeContext`: Manages UI theme preferences.
-   **Real-Time Simulation**:
    -   Data is generated by `telemetrySimulator.js`, which emits new values every 1000ms.
    -   Charts use a sliding window of the last 60 data points.
-   **UI Structure**:
    -   **Grid Layout**: CSS Grid used for a responsive, structured layout (Sidebar, TopBar, Video, Bottom Panel).
    -   **Components**: Modular components for each section (`Sidebar`, `VideoPanel`, `ChartsPanel`, `LogsPanel`).

## Key Decisions

-   **CSS Grid**: Chosen for the main layout to easily manage fixed-size sidebars and flexible content areas.
-   **Context API**: Used for global state like telemetry and theme to avoid prop drilling.
-   **Simulated Data**: A simulator hook mimics WebSocket behavior to demonstrate real-time UI handling without a backend.
